# RPG.py
This is just a simple example of how you could create an RPG using Flask. Depending on the complexity of your game, you may need to add more routes, templates, and logic to handle combat, quests, inventory management, and other features. However, Flask provides a solid foundation for building interactive web applications

To run this code, you will need to follow these steps:

Install Python: If you don't already have Python installed on your computer, you will need to download and install it from the official Python website.
Install Flask: Flask is a web framework for Python, and you can install it using pip, the Python package installer. Open a command prompt or terminal window and type the following command:
Copy code
pip install flask
This will download and install Flask and any dependencies it requires.
Create a new Python file: Open a text editor and create a new file called rpg.py. Copy and paste the RPG code into this file.
Run the Flask app: Open a command prompt or terminal window and navigate to the directory where your rpg.py file is located. Type the following command to start the Flask app:
Copy code
flask run
This will start the Flask app and display the URL where it can be accessed (typically http://localhost:5000/).
Access the RPG in your web browser: Open a web browser and navigate to the URL where your Flask app is running (typically http://localhost:5000/). You should see the main menu for the RPG, and you can navigate to the different screens to view your character, inventory, quests, and combat.
